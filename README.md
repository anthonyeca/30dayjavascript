# 30dayJavaScript 🐱‍💻

I have started to attempt this 30 Day javascript challenge for my own learning.

I really think I need to improve a lot, and this journey could guide me into a new "level".

I will try to do 1 day everyday, but I think that task will be almost impossible because some days I cannot dedicate the time I wish but I have the goal to finish this "30 days challenge"👨🏻‍💻

Long time without practicing (almost 3 months), but I'm decided to make it
